    <h2 id="Covid-19 Documentry">Covid-19 Documentry:</h2>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 
        
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
        
        The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>

        </li>
      </ol>
<h2 id="Make your environment safer">Make your environment safer:</h2>
<p>The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity.Outbreaks have been reported in places where people have gather, often in crowded indoor settings and where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.</p>
<h2>To make your environment as safe as possible:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.
    </li>
    <li>Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.
    </li>
    <li>If you can’t avoid crowded or indoor settings, take these precautions:
        <ul>
            <li>Open a window to increase the amount of natural ventilation when indoors.
            </li>
            <li>Wear a mask</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.
        </li>
    </ul>
